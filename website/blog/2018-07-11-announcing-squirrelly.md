Today, I'm proud to introduce Squirrelly, the best template engine around!

Here's a list of fully implemented features:
1. If statements (with else)
2. Looping through arrays
3. Looping through objects
4. Helper variables
5. Filters (on just global references)

Features being worked on:
1. Filters for everything else
2. Plugins (exposed like Django tags)
3. Partials
4. Layouts
